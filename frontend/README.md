# ArcanaTable - Virtual Tabletop (VTT) Project

## Project Vision
ArcanaTable is a Virtual Tabletop (VTT) project currently under development.  
Its mission is to make playing tabletop RPGs accessible to everyone who wants to experience them.

The motivation behind ArcanaTable stems from issues observed with other existing VTT solutions:
- Many are clunky, unintuitive, or overwhelming for new users.
- Many features are locked behind paywalls.
- Learning curves are steep and discourage new players from entering the hobby.

ArcanaTable aims to **eliminate these barriers**, providing a VTT that is **easy to learn, free to access essential features**, and **genuinely welcoming** to both beginners and veterans of tabletop RPGs.
